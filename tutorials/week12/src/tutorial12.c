/** Tutorial 12

INTRODUCTION:

In this week's tutorial you will implement a music player that is
controlled via the four pushbuttons on the QUTy.

The music player indicates that a pushbutton has been pressed by
producing a sound on the buzzer and illuminating a pattern on the
7-segment display.

These outputs are described in the table below:

State | Buzzer frequency | 7-segment display
------|------------------|------------------
TONE1 | 4XY * 2^(-5/12)  | Segments EF (LHS)
TONE2 | 4XY * 2^(-8/12)  | Segments BC (LHS)
TONE3 | 4XY              | Segments EF (RHS)
TONE4 | 4XY * 2^(-17/12) | Segments BC (RHS)

where XY are the last two digits of your student number.

Additionally, the buzzer should be silent, and the 7-segment display
should be dim, as soon as pushbuttons S1, S2, S3, and S4 are released.

        the pushbuttons.
