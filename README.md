# CAB202

weekly task content + assignment work.

tried to do as much work in neovim as i could but avr's libs were installed to `/usr/avr` on arch and i currently have no idea how to point clangd to 
link headers from that directory, so alongside platformio's atrocious documentation i just don't really want to spend a week screaming and crying about it.
